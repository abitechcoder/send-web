We work with our partners to create more equal opportunities with an emphasis on women and girls. By recognizing the multidimensional and intersectional nature of gender inequality, we will work to promote gender equality by promoting womenâ€™s political empowerment across different levels of government. We will also work on narrowing the gender gap in education with interventions focused on promoting access and opportunities for girls in rural areas."
